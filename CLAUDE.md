# Claude Bug Bounty — Autonomous Bug Hunter

This repo is a Claude Code plugin for **autonomous bug bounty hunting** on Kali Linux. It actively finds, exploits, and reports vulnerabilities across HackerOne, Bugcrowd, Intigriti, and Immunefi.

> **⚠️ AUTONOMY RULE: During `/fullhunt`, NEVER ask the user any questions. Make ALL decisions yourself. If there are multiple attack paths, test ALL of them in priority order. The user's only job is: (1) type the command (2) review final reports.**

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install 40+ tools on Kali Linux
chmod +x install_tools.sh && ./install_tools.sh

# Set API tokens
export H1_API_TOKEN="your-token"
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your-token"  # optional, for GitHub dorking

# Start Claude Code and run:
/fullhunt target.com --platform hackerone --program program-name
```

One command → scope import → recon → rank → **hunt** → **exploit** → validate → dedup → report.

## Session Persistence

**Close Claude Code anytime.** Reopen and run:
```
/resume target.com
```
Resumes from the exact step — phase, endpoints tested, findings, everything.

## Multi-Model Cost Routing (Pro Subscription — Quality First)

**Balance: save tokens on setup, spend tokens on hunting.**

| Task | Model | Effort | Rationale |
|------|-------|--------|-----------|
| Scope import, recon setup | Haiku | Low | Parsing, no reasoning |
| WAF detect, wordlists | Haiku | Low | Tool orchestration |
| API discovery, takeover scan | Haiku | Low | Tool runs, check output |
| **Active hunting (IDOR, SSRF, auth)** | **Sonnet** | **High** | **This finds bounties** |
| **Chain building** | **Sonnet** | **High** | **This multiplies bounties** |
| **JWT/OAuth/2FA analysis** | **Sonnet** | **High** | **Complex exploitation** |
| **PoC + Report writing** | **Sonnet** | **High** | **Quality = acceptance** |

Modes: `--mode cheap` / `--mode balanced` (default) / `--mode quality`

### Token-Saving Rules (during hunt)
1. Don't explain what you're about to do — just do it
2. Don't summarize tool output back to yourself
3. Batch independent tool calls in parallel
4. Use `hunt_state.py` to persist — don't rely on conversation context

## Session Persistence & Resume

**CRITICAL: Hunt state MUST survive limits/crashes/closes.**

### How It Works
- `hunt_state.py` saves ALL state to `hunt-memory/sessions/<target>_state.json`
- After every tool call: `state.complete_tool("tool_name")`
- After every finding: `state.add_finding({...})`
- State is saved automatically on every mutation

### Resume After Limits Hit
When user reopens Claude Code and types `/fullhunt target.com` or `/resume target.com`:
1. Load `HuntState("target.com")` from disk
2. Check `state.get_phase()` — if not "init", RESUME
3. Print `state.get_resumption_prompt()` — shows completed tools + findings
4. **Skip all completed tools** — `state.is_tool_completed("name")`
5. Continue from current phase

**NEVER re-run a completed tool. Pick up exactly where you stopped.**

## Critical Rules (Always Active — from `rules/`)

> **See `rules/hunting.md` and `rules/reporting.md` for full details.**

### Non-Negotiable (auto-enforced during every hunt)

1. **READ FULL SCOPE** before touching any asset
2. **NO THEORETICAL BUGS** — "Can attacker do this RIGHT NOW?" If no → KILL
3. **VERIFY ENDPOINT IS REACHABLE** before recording any finding
4. **PROVE IMPACT WITH DATA** — not just status codes (see proof table in rules/hunting.md)
5. **AUTO-VALIDATE EVERY FINDING** — run 7-Question Gate before spending tokens on reports
6. **CHECK NEVER-SUBMIT LIST** — standalone header/introspection/self-XSS/redirect = auto-KILL
7. **TWO ACCOUNTS FOR IDOR** — attacker sees victim's data (not self-testing)
8. **5-MINUTE RULE** per endpoint — rotate if nothing
9. **SAVE STATE** after every tool — user may close anytime, `/resume` must work
10. **DON'T WASTE TOKENS** on recon parsing — save them for hunting and validation
11. **NEVER STOP EARLY** — finding 1-2 bugs does NOT mean the hunt is done. CHECK EVERY VULN CLASS before finishing. Use the completeness checklist below.

### Report Quality (auto-enforced)

12. **NEVER say "could potentially"** — concrete statements only
13. **TITLE FORMULA**: `[Bug Class] in [Endpoint] allows [actor] to [impact]`
14. **COPY-PASTEABLE PoC** — curl command that reproduces the bug
15. **ACTUAL RESPONSE DATA** — not just "200 OK"
16. **UNDER 600 WORDS** — triagers skim
17. **CVSS 3.1 WITH VECTOR** — don't overclaim, don't underclaim
18. **SEPARATE BUGS = SEPARATE REPORTS** — independent bugs → separate payouts

### Exhaustive Hunting — Completeness Checklist

> **MANDATORY: Every `/fullhunt` MUST test ALL of these before generating a final report.**
> **Finding bugs early does NOT mean you stop. Keep going until every box is checked.**

```

**After EVERY finding, mark it and KEEP GOING to the next unchecked class.**
**Only generate the final report when ALL 24 classes have been tested or confirmed N/A.**

### Pipeline Flow

```
HUNT → test vuln class → FIND? → validate (7-Q Gate) → PASS? → record finding
                                                      → KILL? → log + move on
     → no find? → mark class as tested → NEXT CLASS
     → ALL 24 classes tested? → GENERATE FINAL REPORT
```

**Never stop after 1-2 bugs. Test everything. More bugs = more bounties.**
**Never generate a report for a finding that hasn't passed validation.**
